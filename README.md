# Hand Gesture Recognition Model

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a hand gesture recognition model that accurately identifies and classifies various hand gestures from images. The model utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze and categorize hand gestures for applications such as human-computer interaction and sign language translation.

## Project Description

This project involves creating a machine learning model to recognize hand gestures from images. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled hand gesture images and uses data augmentation techniques to improve performance. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Pillow)

### Model Architecture
The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following architecture:

- Convolutional Layers: Extract features from images.
- Pooling Layers: Reduce dimensionality and retain essential features.
- Dense Layers: Perform classification based on extracted features.
- Dropout: Regularization technique to prevent overfitting.
